# pySequences
Some interesting numeric sequences are implemented along with a sequence handling interface (sums, differences, products, cumulative sums and many more): via "sequence" class.  Plotting representations of sequences with Turtle Graphics as segment plots and spirals.

This tiny Python/Turtle project emerged as I tied to explain basics of number theory (e.g. prime numbers, Fibonacci and Lucas numbers) to a math-affine third grader. Haver fun!

## Usage

To start playing, please launch `main.py`.

## Example: Fibonacci numbers

By calling `fibonacci()`, we can create a sequence of Fibonacci numbers of a requested length. The sequence is sotred as `sequence` attribute:

```
fibonacci_numbers = fibonacci(n = 100)

print(fibonacci_numbers)

Sequence of n = 100 elements
first element = 1.000000e+00
last element = 3.542248e+20

fibonacci_numbers.sequence[0:10]

[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]

```
Ratios of the $i^{th}$ and $(i - 1)^{th}$ elements of the Fibonacci sequence provide incrementally improving approximation of the [Golden Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio). We can handily compute such approximations by calling the `ratio()` method: 

```
golden_ratios = fibonacci_numbers.ratio()

print(golden_ratios)

Sequence of n = 99 elements
first element = 1.000000e+00
last element = 1.618034e+00

## the best approximation in the sequence of 100 Fibonacci
## numbers is:

golden_ratios.last()

1.618033988749895

```

## Example: prime numbers

With the classical [Sieve of Eratosthenes  ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes), we can easily get a sequence of primes smaller than or equal to a given integer. This sequence is implemented by `prime_max()`: 

```
my_primes = prime_max(last = 5000)

print(my_primes)

Sequence of n = 669 elements
first element = 2.000000e+00
last element = 4.999000e+03

my_primes.sequence[0:20]
[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71]
```
In order to check distances between the prime neighbors, we can use `diff()` method and visualize it in a segment plot: 

```
prime_dists = my_primes.diff()

print(prime_dists)

Sequence of n = 668 elements
first element = 1.000000e+00
last element = 6.000000e+00

(prime_dists.min(), prime_dists.max()) ## range of distances between prime neighbors

(1, 34)

segmentPlot(prime_dists, scales = (1, 5)) ## the scales tuple controls the X and Y axis fold-scaling
saveImage('prime_distances') ## saves the current turtle screen as a bitmap

```

With function `ulamSpiral()`, we can re-create the famous (Ulam spiral)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral] and compare it with a spiral for random 669 integers from the 2 to 5000 range:

```
## Ulam spiral for primes:
## scale controls scale of each step, size controls the line width

ulamSpiral(my_primes, scale = 4, size = 2)
saveImage('ulam_spiral_primes')
clearscreen() ## stanradt Python's turtle

## Ulam spiral for random numbers.
## The random numbers are generated by `randint()`:

my_randoms = randint(first = 2, last = 5000, n = len(my_primes))
ulamSpiral(my_randoms, scale = 4, size = 2)
saveImage('ulam_spiral_randoms')

```

## Example: sequence of square roots

In this example, we're going to construct [the Theodorus snail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_of_Theodorus), i.e. a graphical representation of square roots of following integers as hypotenuses of right triangles. We start with the square root sequence generated by `rootint()`: 

```
my_roots = rootint(base = 2, n = 17)

print(my_roots)

Sequence of n = 17 elements
first element = 1.000000e+00
last element = 4.123106e+00

```
The famous spiral is then printed by calling `theodorusSnail()`: 

```
theodorusSnail(my_roots, scale = 100)
saveImage('theodorus_snail')
```
